# rewrite-cljs

This library is a ClojureScript port of it's fabulous big-brother https://github.com/xsc/rewrite-clj[rewrite-clj].
It provides features to traverse and rewrite Clojure/ClojureScript/EDN documents in a whitespace- and comment-aware manner.


TIP: The initial driver for creating the port was to provide Clojure/ClojureScript refactoring support in https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable[Light Table].
But that is just one of many potentially wickedly cool use-cases for this library.





.The library includes:
- An EDN parser
- An EDN aware zipper (using clojure.zip for ClojureScript)
- A customized cljs.reader (based on https://github.com/kanaka/clojurescript/blob/cljs_in_cljs/src/cljs/cljs/reader.cljs[clojurescript-in-clojurescript]) that mimics more of clojure.tools.reader

## Usage

The aim is that this lib should work as closely as possible as it's original Clojure counterpart.
I'll try to document/highlight the individual differences eventually.

### Sample
Here's a little teaser on the sort of things you can do with the zipper features.

(ns rewrite-clj.zip-test
  (:require-macros [cemerick.cljs.test :refer (is deftest )])
  (:require [cemerick.cljs.test :as t]
            [rewrite-clj.zip :as z]
            [rewrite-clj.node :as n]))

(deftest manipulate-sexpr
  (let [sexpr "
 ^{:dynamic true} (+ 1 1
   (+ 2 2)
   (reduce + [1 3 4]))"
        expected "

   (+ 2 2)
   (reduce + [6 7 [1 2]]))"]
    (is (= expected (-> sexpr
                        z/of-string
                        (z/find-tag-by-pos {:row 4 :col 19} :vector)
                        (z/replace [5 6 7])
                        (z/append-child [1 2])
                        z/down
                        z/remove
                        z/root-string)))))

## Limitations and omissions

* There is no support for parsing files (duh)
* cljs.extended.reader which is used for reading edn/clojure/clojurescript, has lot of limitations. Pls don't be surprised
when encountering errors during reading of perhaps legal but hopefully infrequently used language constructs.
* Some features in rewrite-clj is "heavily" based on macros, these features have been omitted for now
** Nice printing of nodes - Not implemented
** https://github.com/xsc/rewrite-clj/blob/master/src/rewrite_clj/zip/subedit.clj[zip subedit support] - Not implemented (YET!)

WARNING: The reader makes a captures positional metadata {:row :col :end-row :end-col} for all nodes.
As long as you are only traversing the nodes you should be fine using the meta data and functions that depend on them (example zip/find-last-by-pos).
However if you perform any form of rewriting the meta-data can't be trusted any longer. Not sure how to address that tbh. Pull requests are more than welcome !


## Rationale


### Why not cljx in the rewrite-clj ?
I'm not really prepared to invest heavily in learning cljx for this particular lib.
https://github.com/xsc[Xsc] and I concluded
that we could consider backporting when cljc http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Reader+Conditionals[Reader Conditionals] becomes more mainstream.


## Clojure/ClojureScript support
If you need to use an older version of ClojureScript (like I do for Light Table), you need to
use an 0.3.x version of the lib.
