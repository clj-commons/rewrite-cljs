# rewrite-cljs

This library is a ClojureScript port of it's fabulous big-brother https://github.com/xsc/rewrite-clj[rewrite-clj].
It provides features to traverse and rewrite Clojure/ClojureScript/EDN documents in a whitespace- and comment-aware manner.


TIP: The initial driver for creating the port was to provide Clojure/ClojureScript refactoring support in https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable[Light Table].
But that is just one of many potentially wickedly cool use-cases for this library.





.The library includes:
- An EDN parser
- An EDN aware zipper (using clojure.zip for ClojureScript)
- A customized cljs.reader (based on https://github.com/kanaka/clojurescript/blob/cljs_in_cljs/src/cljs/cljs/reader.cljs[clojurescript-in-clojurescript]) that mimics more of clojure.tools.reader

## Usage

The aim is that this lib should work as closely as possible as it's original Clojure counterpart.
I'll try to document the individual differences eventually, but for now check out the docs for the
original lib

### Sample
Here's a little teaser on the sort of things you can do with the zipper features.

## Limitations and omissions
* There is no support for parsing files (duh)
* cljs.extended.reader which is used for reading edn/clojure/clojurescript, has lot of limitations. Pls don't be surprised
when encountering errors during reading of perhaps legal but hopefully infrequently used language constructs.
* Some features in rewrite-clj is "heavily" based on macros, these features have been omitted for now
** Nice printing of nodes - Not implemented
** https://github.com/xsc/rewrite-clj/blob/master/src/rewrite_clj/zip/subedit.clj[zip subedit support] - Not implemented (YET!)



## Rationale

### Why the old ClojureScript version ?
Purely selfish reasons. I plan to use this library from Light Table, which currently depends on an old version.


### Why not cljx in the rewrite-clj ?
I'm not really prepared to invest heavily in learning cljx for this particular lib.
https://github.com/xsc[Xsc] and I concluded
that we could consider backporting when cljc (http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Reader+Conditionals [Reader Conditionals]) becomes more mainstream.
